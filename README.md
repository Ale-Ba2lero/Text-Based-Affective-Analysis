## Text Based Affective Analysis

Abstract—The goal of this analysis is to study the correlations between gaze features and human emotions, using NLP techniques.
The theories and studies underlying emotions are different, making it impossible to unify their representation. For this reason we have decided to carry out this analysis using the two main theories of emotions: Paul Ekman’s theory on discrete emotions and Russell’s theory on core affect.
We decided to structure the analysis following two different approaches. The first approach consists on analyzing the emotional score values (both continuous and discrete) of the individual words to see whether they could provide meaningful information even if taken without context. The second approach consists of analyzing the whole sentences, their emotional values, and their relations with the eye-tracker features.
The sentence-based analysis discovered meaningful relationships between some eye-tracker features and discrete emotions,
which were also partially confirmed by the word-based analysis.
On the other hand, our models performed poorly when applied to the core affect context, not being able to distinguish between the VAD features.
